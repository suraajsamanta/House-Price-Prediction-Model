# House-Price-Prediction-Model



This data science project is based around a real estate price prediction website. 

First, created a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
This model involved using Jupyter Notebook for data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation, etc.

Second, I wrote a Python flask server that uses the saved model in a Pickle file to serve HTTP requests.

Third, I built a website in HTML, CSS, and Javascript that allows the user to enter the home square feet area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and area. This website calls the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 
Other tools used throughout this project includes:


-Python

-Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning

-Matplotlib for data visualization

-Sklearn for model building

-Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE

-Python flask for http server

-HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
